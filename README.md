Hello, in this repository I will document my notes on the book "Algorithms for Optimization" from Mykel J. Kochenderfer and Tim A. Wheeler using [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) in Julia.

# Chapter 1 - Introduction
First chapter states that everything in our lives can be optimized, and every optimization problem can be translated into minimizing an objective function.

# Chapter 2 - Derivatives and Gradients
Second chapter introduce the notion of derivatives in multiple dimensions and how to approximate derivatives using numerical methods, noting that the use of the dual numbers and the complex step method can give us great approximations compared with traditional methods.

# Chapter 3 - Bracketing
